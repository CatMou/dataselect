.SH NAME
Mini-SEED data selection, sorting and pruning

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
dataselect [options] file1 [file2 file3 ...]

.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdataselect\fP selects, sorts and prunes Mini-SEED data.  Any output
data will always be sorted by ascending time-series.  Various data
selection operations are possible including time criteria, the removal
of duplicate data and the splicing of partially overlapping data
records to form continuous time-series.

Data pruning, removal of overlap, can be performed at either the
record or sample level.  Pruning at the record level guarantees that
records are never unpacked/repacked, but this could potentially leave
small amounts of overlap in the data.  Pruning at the sample level
will remove any overlap and splice data to within the time-series
tolerance, this requires the unpacking and repacking of data records
and is done in a modification-minimizing way.

When removing overlapping data records or samples the concept of
priority is used to determine from which time-series data should be
removed if overlaps are detected.  By default the priority is given to
the highest quality data (M > Q > D > R).  When the qualities are the
same priority is given to the longer segment.

Multiple input files will be read in the order specified and processed
all together as if all the data records were from the same file.  The
program must read input data from files, input from pipes, etc. is not
possible.

When a input file is full SEED including both SEED headers and data
records all of the headers will be skipped and completely unprocessed.

.SH OPTIONS

.IP "-V         "
Print program version and exit.

.IP "-h         "
Print program usage and exit.

.IP "-H         "
Print verbose program usage including details of archive format
specification and exit.

.IP "-v         "
Be more verbose.  This flag can be used multiple times ("-v -v" or
"-vv") for more verbosity.

.IP "-tt \fIsecs\fP"
Specify a time tolerance for constructing continous trace
segments. The tolerance is specified in seconds.  The default
tolerance is 1/2 of the sample period.

.IP "-rt \fIdiff\fP"
Specify a sample rate tolerance for constructing continous trace
segments. The tolerance is specified as the difference between two
sampling rates.  The default tolerance is tested as: (abs(1-sr1/sr2) <
0.0001).

.IP "-E\fP"
Consider all data qualities equal when determining priority for
pruning.  By default priority is given the the data with the highest
quality indicator: (highest) Q > D > R (lowest).

.IP "-ts \fItime\fP"
Limit processing to Mini-SEED records that start after or contain
\fItime\fP.  The format of the \fItime\fP argument
is: 'YYYY[,DDD,HH,MM,SS,FFFFFF]' where valid delimiters are either
commas (,), colons (:) or periods (.).

.IP "-te \fItime\fP"
Limit processing to Mini-SEED records that end before or contain
\fItime\fP.  The format of the \fItime\fP argument
is: 'YYYY[,DDD,HH,MM,SS,FFFFFF]' where valid delimiters are either
commas (,), colons (:) or periods (.).

.IP "-M \fImatch\fP"
Limit input to records that match this regular expression, the
\fImatch\fP is tested against the full source
name: 'NET_STA_LOC_CHAN_QUAL'.  If the match expression begins with
an '@' character it is assumed to indicate a file containing a list of
expressions to match, see the \fBLIST FILE\fR section below.

.IP "-R \fIreject\fP"
Limit input to records that do not match this regular expression, the
\fIreject\fP is tested against the full source
name: 'NET_STA_LOC_CHAN_QUAL'.  If the reject expression begins with
an '@' character it is assumed to indicate a file containing a list of
expressions to reject, see the \fBLIST FILE\fR section below.

.IP "-rep"
Replace input files.  By default this will rename the original files
by adding a '.orig' suffix.

.IP "-nb"
Do not keep backups of renamed original input files if replacing them
by using the \fI-rep\fP option.

.IP "-o \fIfile\fP"
Write all output data to output \fIfile\fP instead of replacing the
original files.  When this option is used no backups will be created
and the original files will not be modified in any way.  If '-' is
specified as the output file all output data will be written to
standard out.

.IP "-A \fIformat\fR"
All output records will be written to a directory/file layout defined
by \fIformat\fP.  All directories implied in the \fIformat\fP string
will be created if necessary.  The option may be used multiple times
to write input records to multiple archives.  See the \fBARCHIVE
FORMAT\fR section below for more details including pre-defined archive
layouts.

.IP "-CHAN \fIdirectory\fR"
.IP "-QCHAN \fIdirectory\fR"
.IP "-CDAY \fIdirectory\fR"
.IP "-BUD \fIdirectory\fR"
.IP "-CSS \fIdirectory\fR"
Pre-defined output archive formats, see the \fBArchive Format\fR
section below for more details.

.IP "-Pr         "
Prune, remove overlap data, at the record level.  This will result in
removal of all the completely overlapped data records.  Small,
partial-record overlaps might remain in the data.

.IP "-Ps         "
Prune, remove overlap data, at the sample level.  This will result in
removal of all the completely overlapped data samples.  When data
records partially overlap the lowest priority record is unpacked,
trimmed and repacked.

.IP "-S[dhm]      "
Split records on day, hour or minute boundaries.  When data records
span the split boundary (day, hour or minute) the record will be split
by duplicating the record and trimming both records such they are
continous across the boundaries.  Both of the records will have the
same record number.

.IP "-Q DRQM      "
Change the data quality indicator for all output records to the
specified quality: D, R, Q or M.

.IP "-sum         "
Print a basic summary of input data after reading all the files.

.IP "-mod         "
Print a file modification summary after processing an input group.
For files specified on the command line all files constitute a group.
For POD structure processing input files are grouped by channel and
processed separately.  By default this summary will only include the
files that were modified, if the verbose option is used the summary
will include all files processed.

.IP "-POD \fIreqfile\fP \fIdatadir\fP"
Prune a POD data structure based on the supplied request file and data
directory.  The request file is re-written and a backup of the original
should remain ('.orig' is appended to the original).

.SH THE PRUNING PROCESS

The pruning algorithm used is independant of the file structure and
organization.  Data from all input files is parsed and a map created
for every data record and their relationship in continuous time
series segments.

Each data record time coverage in each continuous time-series is
compared to the time coverage of every other continous time-series.
When overlap is detected, data is removed from the lower priority
time-series until the overlap is minimized or completely removed
depending on the pruning option specified.

.SH "LIST FILE"
A list file used with either the \fB-M\fP or \fB-R\fP contains a list
of regular expressions (one on each line) that will be combined into a
single compound expression.  The initial '@' character indicating a
list file is not considered part of the file name.  As an example, if
the following command line option was used:

.nf
\fB-M @match.list\fP
.fi

The 'match.list' file might look like this:

.nf
IU_ANMO_.*
IU_ADK_00_BHZ.*
II_BFO_00_BHZ_Q
.fi

.SH "ARCHIVE FORMAT"
The pre-defined archive layouts are as follows:

.nf
-CHAN dir   :: dir/%n.%s.%l.%c
-QCHAN dir  :: dir/%n.%s.%l.%c.%q
-CDAY dir   :: dir/%n.%s.%l.%c.%Y:%j:#H:#M:#S
-BUD dir    :: dir/%n/%s/%s.%n.%l.%c.%Y.%j
-CSS dir    :: dir/%Y/%j/%s.%c.%Y:%j:#H:#M:#S
.fi

An archive format is expanded for each record using the following
substitution flags:

.nf
  \fBn\fP : network code, white space removed
  \fBs\fP : station code, white space removed
  \fBl\fP : location code, white space removed
  \fBc\fP : channel code, white space removed
  \fBY\fP : year, 4 digits
  \fBy\fP : year, 2 digits zero padded
  \fBj\fP : day of year, 3 digits zero padded
  \fBH\fP : hour, 2 digits zero padded
  \fBM\fP : minute, 2 digits zero padded
  \fBS\fP : second, 2 digits zero padded
  \fBF\fP : fractional seconds, 4 digits zero padded
  \fBq\fP : single character record quality indicator (D, R, Q)
  \fBL\fP : data record length in bytes
  \fBr\fP : sample rate (Hz) as a rounded integer
  \fBR\fP : sample rate (Hz) as a float with 6 digit precision
  \fB%\fP : the percent (%) character
  \fB#\fP : the number (#) character
.fi

The flags are prefaced with either the \fB%\fP or \fB#\fP modifier.
The \fB%\fP modifier indicates a defining flag while the \fB#\fP
indicates a non-defining flag.  All records with the same set of
defining flags will be written to the same file.  Non-defining flags
will be expanded using the values in the first record for the
resulting file name.

Time flags are based on the start time of the given record.

.SH EXAMPLES

The format string for the predefined \fIBUD\fP layout:

\fB/archive/%n/%s/%s.%n.%l.%c.%Y.%j\fP

would expand to day length files named something like:

\fB/archive/NL/HGN/HGN.NL..BHE.2003.055\fP

As an example of using non-defining flags the format string for the
predefined \fICSS\fP layout:

\fB/data/%Y/%j/%s.%c.%Y:%j:#H:#M:#S\fP

would expand to:

\fB/data/2003/055/HGN.BHE.2003:055:14:17:54\fP

resulting in day length files because the hour, minute and second are
specified with the non-defining modifier.  The hour, minute and second
fields are from the first record in the file.

.SH ERROR HANDLING AND RETURN CODES
Any significant error message will be pre-pended with "ERROR" which
can be parsed to determine run-time errors.  Additionally the program
will return an exit code of 0 on successful operation and 1 when any
errors were encountered.
