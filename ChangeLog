2008.212:
	- Fix corner case pruning of exact record boundary matches.
	- Improve error message when record trim boundaries are bad.

2008.200:
	- Change total record and byte count variables to 64-bit
	integers to avoid overflow.

2008.162: 1.1
	- Update libmseed to 2.1.5.
	- Use normalized (time correction applied) start time when
	writing records to user defined archive files.
	
2000.067: 1.0
	- Update man page.

2008.056: 0.9.9
	- Use defined time-tolerance to determine if a record is
	completely overlapped or should be trimmed to avoid confusion
	when trimming sub-sample (impossible) time slices.

2008.042: 0.9.8
	- Change log message prefix from "ERROR" to "Warning" when
        files in the request records (of the "h" file) cannot be
	found during POD processing.

2008.032: 0.9.7
	- Change timewindowing logic to include a data record when
	the start or end time is contained within the record.

2008.032: 0.9.6
	- Return 0 instead of 1 when no data is going to be output
	but no other problems were encountered.
	- Add section in man page regarding error messages and exit
	codes.

2007.353: 0.9.5
	- Create a special out-of-band MSTrace to hold records with
	zero sample rate (e.g. LOG, ACE, etc channels).  This avoids
	the creation of an MSTrace for each record.
	- Specifically exclude the OOB MSTrace from pruning.

2007.337: 0.9.4
	- Exit with message when no output options were specified. 
	- Do not allow deleting of backup files (nobackups) when not
	replacing input files.
	- The POD option now implicitly means replacing input files.
 
2007.324: 0.9.3
	- Fix free'ing of file lists, which fixes POD processing.
	- Fix coverage detection of exactly matching trace entries.
	- Fix small mostly unimportant memory leaks.

2007.319: 0.9.2
	- Modularization of shared functions to reduce confusing
	dependency on global variables and structures.

2007.318: 0.9.1
	- Rework pruning process, more comprehensively includes coverage
	of all overlapping data segments during pruning.

2007.268: 0.9
	- Diagnostic return values: 0=success 1=error.
	- Rename global MSTraceGroup from 'mstg' to 'gmstg' to avoid
	future confusion when reading this code.

2007.267: 0.8
	- Update to libmseed 2.1.4.
	- Update logic for "M" quality addition.
	- Add QCHAN preset layout, like CHAN but adds quality code.

2007.149: 0.7.2
	- Update to libmseed 2.1.2.

2007.144: 0.7.1
	- Update to libmseed 2.1.1.

2007.102: 0.7
	- Update to libmseed 2.1.
	- Create man page.

2007.100:
	- Fix start time limit option (-ts) record skipping logic.

2007.031: 0.6
	- Update to libmseed 2.0 final.
	- Generalize src/Makefile so user defined CC and CFLAGS are
	recongized and used.

2007.024: 0.5
	- Update to libmseed 2.0 test.
	- Take -lm out of link parameters as it's no longer needed.

2006.362:
	- reconcile_tracetimes(): minor optimization when searching for
	first and last records for a given MSTrace by searching from the
	beginning and end only as far as needed.
	- reconcile_tracetimes(): use boundary start and end times when
	they are set instead of the records original start and end times.

2006.354: 0.4
	- Convert all diagnostic output to use ms_log routines.
	- Fix reconcile_tracetimes() by resetting first/last pointers.

2006.354: 0.3
	- Update to libmseed 2.0rc1.
	- Add -lm to link libraries in src/Makefile.

2006.296: 0.2
	- Update to libmseed 2.0pre3.
	- Do not sort MSTraceGroup using the quality indicator so output
	files include data in time order ungrouped from quality.

2006.235: 0.1
	- Add -S[dhm] options to split records on day, hour and
	minute boundaries.

2006.230:
	- Add regex match/reject options using libc POSIX routines.
	Include ability to specify files containing regexs if the
	pattern is specified with a first '@' character.
	- Rework usage and options quite a bit, remove the -a and
	options, all record lengths are automatically detected.

2006.224:
	- Start with msprune 0.9.2.
	- Add dsarchive.[ch] code from msrouter 1.9.
	- Rework to write output data independently to a single output
	file, any number of Archives or replacing original files.
	- Make pruning optional and use a single variable to control
	pruning at the record or sample level.
	- Make replacement of input files controlled via an option.
